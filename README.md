# same-aim

A tool to help find relative mouse sensitivities between two 3d games

Primarily works by:
* setting up a hotkey to move left, down, and reseting the counter.
* using the left hotkey to move counter clockwise 360 degrees in one game and noting the counter
* doing the same process in another game with the goal of getting the same counter value from game one adjusting ingame sensitivity as necessary

This same process can be done for the y axix using the down hotkey.
